    "A budding music teacher is interested in setting up shop in Manhattan, New York City. Being in the big city, he is unsure of where the best place would be for him to open up his new music school. However, he understands the power of data in order to make a more informed decision. Therefore, utilising data, he would like to determine where the best place to open up a new music school would be. "

Then, based on this dataset and the given lattitude and longitudes of the neighbourhoods, the Foursquare API will be queried in order to find out the distribution of music schools in each neighbourhood. Then, based on the neighbourhood with the lowest density of music schools available, it could be used to determine whether or not the new music school teacher should set up shop there.\n"
